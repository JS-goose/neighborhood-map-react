# Neighborhood Map Project
This is the final project (#7) in Udacity's FEND Nanodegree.  Below you will find instructions on getting this app to run on your machine.

# Description
This is an interactive map displaying parks around the city of San Antonio.  The markers drop in upon page load and bounce when clicked or when the corresponding venue is clicked in the venue list.  The venue list may be hidden at anytime simply by clicking the "Menu" button.

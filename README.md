# Neighborhood Map Project
This is the final project (#7) in Udacity's FEND Nanodegree.  Below you will find instructions on getting this app to run on your machine.

## Description
This is an interactive map displaying parks around the city of San Antonio.  The markers drop in upon page load and bounce when clicked or when the corresponding venue is clicked in the venue list.  The venue list may be hidden/shown at anytime simply by clicking the "Menu" button.

## Getting Started
If you want to get your own copy of the neighborhood map just follow these simple steps.

### Get your Google Maps API key
You'll need to get your own API key for the Google Maps service and it can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key)
